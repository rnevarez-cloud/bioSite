Her study abroad program also inspired her to continuously try new things and be open to whatever opportunities presented themselves. This led to her attending field school after graduation in Italy. Camila assisted in restoring old paintings and frescoes. Some of these artworks were created as early as the 3rd century! Camila gained popularity with her professors and advisors on this trip, discovering that she had a knack for art restoration.
