                <p>Camila is a girl who loves to engage in arts, crafts, and the world around her. In her free time, she loves to read and paint. Her education at The Ohio State University led her to various places in Italy where she got to engage with the country's rich culture. She even had the opportunity to restore precious artwork, including paintings and frescoes!</p>

                        <p class="text">Camila spends most of her time reading books. Ever since she was in elementary school, she would always be reading something. Her reading habits have even influenced some of her friends to read more! Her favorite book is Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen.</p>

                        <p class="text">Camila loves to paint in her free time. In this picture, she is working on a frame taken from the cartoon "Spongebob Squarepants". While she enjoys to paint freely on a canvas, she also enjoys more guided forms of painting, such as painting by numbers. She has many paint by numbers pieces hung up around her home.</p>

                        <p class="text">In Italy, Camila had to create her own fresco from scratch, which was not an easy task since it is a very delicate medium to work in. This exercise helped the group understand how frescoes were made in the past. She had to make rabbit skin glue, which she would put onto the wall. Then, she glued the canvas to the wall. Afterwards, she painted the canvas with a clay-like substance. These frescoes are still in rural Italy today!</p>
